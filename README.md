# IC2Server
C2 server created using Joe Helles Python C2 course and using his additions to the C2 (https://github.com/dievus/Python3-C2-Course-Code-Modules).
IC2 has SMPT, File Transfers, and a way to secure the payloads. Additional functionality is planned to be added but will take some time to add and research.
